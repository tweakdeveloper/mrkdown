# mrkdown Code of Conduct

While mrkdown is (at the moment) a personal project, I recognize that any
future contributors will come from a background that likely differs
significantly from mine. This leads to the following declaration to ensure that
all future contributors are treated with respect:

mrkdown will work within the terms of the
[Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
Contributors are expected to comply with the guidelines, except that as this is
not a Mozilla project, the reporting process will differ.

## Reporting

Violations can be reported using a GitHub issue. A template will be created for
this purpose in the future, at which point this document will be updated with a
direct link to the issue template. For now, should any issues arise, please
feel free to create a freeform issue with the prefix `[CoC violation]` in the
issue title.
